# Password Generator

This web app will generate a random password based on user determined length.
Accepts special characters, upper case, lower case, and numbers, or any combination thereof.
Must be between 8 and 128 characters long. However, this is hardwired in the code, and is easily mutable. 
This can be achieved by a simple edit in the script.js file.
