# passwordGenerator
# author: @superrmatt
# web app which will generate a random password based on user determined length.
# accepts special characters, upper case, lower case, and numbers.
# must be between 8 and 128 characters long.
# functionality for more or lesss characters is certainly possible by a simple edit in the script.js file.
